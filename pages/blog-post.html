          𝐓𝐇𝐄 𝐇𝐈𝐃𝐃𝐄𝐍 𝐇𝐎𝐏𝐄! 
          Sometimes things go you out of your hand ,
          Now you cannot even repent; 
          those irritating voices, have to listen as no choices; 
          those immaturities in the elder ones, 
          which cannot be forgiven further but once .
          
          That sense of overridden responsibilities, 
          which fills you with all abnormalities;  People running away from their duties,and behaving as boobies.
          
          Those insecurities ,
          Even after assurities ;
          which cannot even be shared,
          as they all sound very weird. 
          Those irrelevant, unnecessary list of questions,
          That fills you with vexation. 
          All the feelings kept unsaid ,
          and can never be shared that's very sad! Sometimes brain says-
           Be brave and let them pay,
           But heart consoles -for whom you pray,can't be your prey .. Now want to yell and shout,
           So that all pain comes out,
           My dear if this be done, 
          You will suffer the loss which would infinite tonne.
          
          When your strength start turning into weaknesses, 
          your Pride into shame, 
          your courage starts to fade ,
          when shoulders unable to bear,
          When heart cries hard, 
          just when the Crown starts slipping aside,
          internal power plays its Part,
          tells u,all to discard.
          
          To survive in this wild world,
          Have patience my girl, 
          if you let the Crown fall, 
          will be difficult to again build it all.
          
          You are the strength,
          You are the pride,
          You are very needed,
          now that's not right, Now let not the scenario be repeated,
           keep the faith
           and let be treated.You are with you, You are for you,they are on you, 
          Keep the smile, 
          Let the heart wipe, 
          Tell shoulders to revive, 
          The head to held high, 
          Hold the crown 
          And don't let it down, 
          Whatever be, go shunned..... But promise to yourself, 
          Whenever you'll come up- "You'll be the sun!!
